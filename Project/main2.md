# Project Unit 1 : A simple currency converter
## Criterion A: Planning

## Problem definition: 
I have been hired by a school teacher who is in charge of school computers. These computers are also for usage of other teachers and they contain office applications for only teacher use. These office apps are locked to prevent student use. Now, the problem is not every teacher knows all the passwords for certain apps, so they need see the list of passwords to be able to access these apps.

## Proposed Solution:
I am proposing, to create a currency converter (which is very unattractive application for student use) which contains a secret function that is only revealed when a hidden code is entered. ONce the correct codde is typed into the currency converter, it transforms into the password manager that the teacher requires. This is an  adequate solution for that teacher as it solves the problem or keeping password information both protected and hidden.

## Success criteria:
